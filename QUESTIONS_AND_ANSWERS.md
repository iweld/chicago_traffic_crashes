An SQL analysis about each traffic crash on city streets within the City of Chicago limits and under the jurisdiction of Chicago Police Department (CPD). Data shown as is from the electronic crash reporting system (E-Crash) at CPD, excluding any personally identifiable information.


#### What is the total count of recorded crashes in the complete dataset?

````sql
SELECT
	count(*) AS total_records
FROM
	crashes;
````

**Results:**

total_records|
-------------|
686276|

#### What is the count of Homicides, Battery and Assaults reported?

````sql
SELECT 
	crime_type,
	count(*) AS n_crimes
FROM 
	crimes
WHERE 
	crime_type IN ('homicide', 'battery', 'assault')
group BY 
	crime_type
order BY 
	n_crimes DESC;
````

**Results:**

crime_type|n_crimes|
----------|--------|
battery   |   39988|
assault   |   20086|
homicide  |     803|

#### Create a temp table that joins data from all three tables

````sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS chicago_crimes;
CREATE TEMP TABLE chicago_crimes AS (
	SELECT
		cr.crime_id, 
		date_trunc('second', cr.crime_date) AS crime_date,
		cr.crime_date::timestamp::time AS time_reported,
		cr.crime_type,
		cr.crime_description,
		cr.location_description,
		cr.street_name,
		co.community_name,
		co.population ,
		co.area_size,
		co.density,
		cr.arrest, 
		cr.domestic,
		w.temp_high, 
		w.temp_low, 
		w.precipitation,
		cr.latitude,
		cr.longitude
	FROM crimes AS cr
	JOIN community AS co
	ON cr.community_id = co.area_id
	JOIN weather AS w
	ON w.weather_date = date(cr.crime_date)
);

SELECT * FROM chicago_crimes LIMIT 10;
````

**Results:**
